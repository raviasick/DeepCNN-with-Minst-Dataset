# Deep Convolutional Neural Network (DeepCNN) for MNIST Classification

This project implements a deep convolutional neural network (DeepCNN) to classify handwritten digits from the MNIST dataset. The model is trained using TensorFlow and includes dataset visualization, model training, evaluation with a confusion matrix, and performance metric plots.

## ðŸ“Œ Features
- Uses TensorFlow's Keras API to define a DeepCNN model.
- Includes dataset visualization.
- Trains the model on the MNIST dataset.
- Evaluates the model using a confusion matrix.
- Computes accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
- Plots the confusion matrix and performance metrics.

## ðŸ›  Requirements
Ensure you have Python 3.11 installed. Install the necessary dependencies using:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
